# GSA_OT

The code is divided as follows:
- Each directory contains the code in a specific language (`matlab`Â and `R` for the moment)
- The arguments of the functions are usually defined as follows:
  - `x` is a inputs matrix. Each row is an observation and each column is a variable
  - `y` is a outputs matrix. Each row is an observation and each column is a variable
  - `M` is the number of partitions
- The code is usually commented and indented. Other inputs may be necessary. You can find their meaning inside the files.
