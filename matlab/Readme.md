"Entropic Wasserstein? That's esoteric crystal healing!"

This folder contains some implementations of optimal transport related algorithms, including

* (approximate) solvers for linear assignment problems (#sources = #sinks)
* linear programmes for general problems
* Sinkhorn algorithms from entropic Wasserstein distances
* OT-based sensitivity measures for 1D and multidimensional outputs
* Bures-Wasserstein sensitivity measure
* some other sensitivity measures to compare with
* and some utility functions
